This is a classic chocolate mousse **made the proper French way,** as served in **fine dining restaurants**. Less cream, more chocolate, a more intense chocolate flavour and a beautiful creamy mouth feel.



**M﻿ethod**

1. **Beat egg whites** and sugar until foamy;
2. **Soft peaks** – it should be foamy but have SOFT peaks that flop at the top – as pictured above – not standing upright (“firm peaks”);
3. **Whip cream;**
4. **Fold together** cream and egg yolks;
5. **Fold** in melted chocolate;
6. **Fold egg whites** into chocolate mixture. *Don’t beat furiously* – that’s the sure fire way to a pot of liquid chocolate!
7. **Spoon** into individual pots or a larger dish, chill until firm.
