## Ingredients

* 3 eggs 
* 125g dark cooking chocolate , bittersweet / 70% cocoa 
* 10g unsalted butter
* 125 ml cream , full fat 
* 35 g caster sugar (superfine white sugar)



## Method

* For reliable results, work at a steady pace so your whipped egg whites and cream do not get too warm!
* **Separate eggs and yolks** while eggs are cold. Place whites in a large bowl and yolks in a small bowl. Leave whites while you prepare other ingredients. (Note 4)
* **Yolks:** Whisk yolks until uniform.
* **Melt chocolate and butter:** Break chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave-proof bowl with the butter. Melt in the microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. (Stir in optional flavourings at this point, but read Note 6 first). Set aside to cool slightly while you proceed with other steps.
* **Whip cream:** Beat cream until stiff peaks form, being careful not to over-whip (see video).
* **Whip whites:** Add sugar. Beat whites until firm peaks form (see video, Note 5)



#### FOLD TOGETHER ALL INGREDIENTS:

* Fold egg yolks into cream using a rubber spatula – 8 folds max. Some streaks is fine.
* **Check chocolate temperature:** The chocolate should still be runny but warm (min 35C / 95F; ideal 40C / 104F). If too cool or thick, microwave in burst of 5 seconds at a time until runny.
* Pour chocolate into cream yolk mixture. Fold through – 8 folds max. Some streaks here are ok.
* Add 1/4 of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture. Fold through until incorporated – "smear" the spatular across surface to blend white lumps in – aim for 10 folds. 
* Pour chocolate mixture into egg whites. Fold through until incorporated and no more white lumps remain – aim for 12 folds max, but ensure there are no obvious egg white patches.
* Divide mixture between 4 small glasses or pots. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
* To serve, garnish with cream and chocolate shavings. Raspberries and a tiny sprig of mint for colour would also be lovely!
